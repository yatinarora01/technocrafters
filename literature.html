        <h2>Literature and Folklore</h2>
        <p>The idea, the word, ‘folk’ has wide range of understanding and connotations – ranging from
             ‘natural’ to ‘native’ to ‘traditional’ to ‘rural’ and in some cases ‘from the heart.’ 
             The ‘outpourings from the heart’ of native or traditional people later takes the form of folklore.</p>
             <p>All folklores are oral traditions, the lore, traditional knowledge and beliefs of cultures often
                 having no written language and they are transmitted, generally, by word of mouth. Like the written 
                 literature they contain both prose and verse narratives in addition to myths, dramas, rituals etc. 
                 All the cultures have their own folklores.In contrast and traditionally, literature is understood 
                 to mean any written work.</p>
                 <p>All folklores do more than merely conveying heart-pourings of natives about the nature around them.
                     They are often, nay, always the carriers of culture, of social mores, customs and forms of behaviour
                      – that is a society, nay, life in a nutshell. Folklores contain the lofty thoughts of yore and highest 
                      metaphysical truths, normally incomprehensible to laymen, in a subtle, story forms.</p>
        <p>Literature, in written form, helps in preserving the folklores and oral traditions. But for the literature in 
            this form, the world would have lost almost all the folk and oral traditions. Written books, as recordings 
            of folklores help in passing on the lofty thoughts and ideas to posterity with no or very little changes in 
            contrast to oral traditions where they often get lost in transition. Literature also can highlight the relevance
             of the stories of the past to the generation of the present, something which the oral traditions cannot strongly do.</p>
            <p>Indian Literature, compared to any other literature in the world, played a dominant role in the preservation
                 and propagation of oral traditions and folklores. Very ancients of this land, India, were past masters of all 
                 art forms that is folk. Sama Veda, to name one, is probably oldest form of folk music that has survived till 
                 date. Even if one takesSama Veda as a rusty folk music, then it is the finest and ancient folk music that the
                  world has ever witnessed.</p>
            <p>India remains one of the world’s richest sources of folktales. Not merely folktales but all forms of oral 
                traditions – proverbs, aphorisms, anecdotes, rumours, songs, impromptu folk street plays – mirror the culture
                 and values of the land in which they take place. They have also helped in binding vastly differing mores and
                  customs of even a single given place. India is one place where the speech of even the most illiterate farmer
                   is filled with lofty thoughts and metaphors.</p>
                   <p>In the modern democratic India, folk literature is pursued both within the academia and outside it
                     unlike many other cultures. Efforts of Sahitya Akademi and other similar organizations form part of this 
                     collective attempt to preserve and disseminate Indian folk literature.</p>
