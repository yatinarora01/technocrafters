    <h2>My Government Platform </h2>

    <p>
     MyGov has been established as Government of India’s Citizen Engagement Platform which 
        collaborates with multiple Government bodies/ Ministries to engage with citizens for policy formulation 
        and seeks the opinion of people on issues/ topics of public interest and welfare.The MyGov app is developed by
         the National Informatics Centre that comes under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.
         MyGov has also launched State instances in 23 States, namely Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, 
         Assam, Manipur, Tripura, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Nagaland, Uttarakhand, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, 
         karnataka, Gujarat, Dadra and Nagar Haveli & Daman and Diu, Mizoram, Rajasthan, Ladakh and Andaman & Nicobar Islands.
         MyGov is one of the platforms through which citizens can submit input for the monthly Program of the PM called Mann ki Baat broadcast
          over the radio. Citizens can submit input on the MyGov forum or on the Toll Free Number 1800-11-7800 once the line is opened.
          In the first week of August 2014, MyGov received 100,000 registered users, barely two weeks after its initiation. Google became the 
          first multinational firm to collaborate with MyGov. Shortly before his first address to the nation through All India Radio, it was 
          announced that ideas and questions for the Prime Minister submitted to MyGov may be responded to in subsequent radio addresses.

            the Ministry of Culture in India was being led by G. Kishan Reddy. He served as the Minister of Culture, as well as the Minister of Tourism and the Minister of Development of North Eastern Region. The Ministry of Culture plays a crucial role in preserving and promoting India's rich cultural heritage, fostering the arts,
             and supporting cultural initiatives and institutions across the country.
Under the leadership of G. Kishan Reddy, the ministry likely continued its efforts to safeguard and showcase
 India's diverse cultural traditions, heritage sites, and artistic expressions. Initiatives related to the preservation of historical monuments, promotion of traditional art forms, and cultural exchange programs both within the country and internationally are typically within the purview of the Ministry of Culture.
For the most current and detailed information on the Ministry of Culture in India, including any changes in leadership or policy developments, it is advisable to refer to the official website of the Government of India or consult recent news sources as my information is based on the situation as of January 2022.
