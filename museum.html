        <h2>Museums</h2>
        <p>The National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA), founded in 1954, is the only
             institution of its kind in the country representing evolution and pictorial 
             transformation in visual arts over the last more than 150 years. NGMA functions
              as a subordinate office under the superintendence and administrative control of the Ministry of Culture.
        </p>
        <p>The main objectives of the NGMA are to create an understanding and sensibility among the Indian public towards
             the visual and plastic arts in general and to promote the development of contemporary Indian art in particular.
              In 2009, NGMA inaugurated the opening of its New Extension Wing at New Delhi which increased its display spaces
               by more than 6 times.

         <p>The Salar Jung Museum of Hyderabad is a repository of the artistic achievements of diverse European, Asian 
            and Far Eastern countries of the world. The major portion of this collection was acquired by Nawab Mir Yousuf
             Ali Khan popularly known as Salar Jung III. The zeal for acquiring art objects continued as a family tradition
              for three generations of Salar Jungs. In 1914, Salar Jung III, after having relinquished the post of Prime 
              Minister to H.E.H., the Nizam VII, Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan, devoted rest of his entire life in collecting and 
              enriching the treasures of art and literature till he lived. The precious and rare art objects collected by 
              him for a period of over forty years, find place in the portals of the Salar Jung Museum, as rare to very rare 
              pieces of art.

            <p>The Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH), Kolkata, was founded principally through the efforts of Viceroy Lord
            Curzon, as a period museum in memory of Queen Victoria. Its foundation stone was laid in 1906 and the
            57-acre campus was formally opened to the public in 1921. The VMH was declared an institution of National
            importance by the Government of India Act of 1935. The VMH’s objective is to be the premier period museum 
            in the world on Indo-British history in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. On a local level,
            it seeks to function as the premier museum, art gallery, research library, and cultural space in the city
            of Kolkata. It has been widely hailed as the finest specimen of Indo-British architecture in India, and 
            called the ‘Taj of the Raj’. The VMH is currently the most-visited museum in India and one of the top museums
            in the world in terms of footfall. It’s rapidly rising global stature as a top tourist destination in India is 
            indicated by the award of a Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence in 2015, and of Lonely Planet ‘Top Choice’ 
            and ‘Fodor’s ratings, accolades coveted by most museums of the world.
