        <h2>World Heritage</h2>

    <p>Culture plays an important role in the development of any nation. 
    It represents a set of shared attitudes, values, goals and practices.
    Culture and creativity manifest themselves in almost all economic, social
    and other activities. A country as diverse as India is symbolized by the 
    plurality of its culture. Article 29 of the Constitution of India, 1950 
    forebears the dictum of Unity in Diversity to which this ancient civilization adheres to:
    </p>
    <p>"...Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having
     a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same".
     </p>

<p>Article 29 (2) of the Constitution of India speaks of Cultural and Educational Rights also refer
 to the protection of interests of minorities:
</p>
<p>
“...No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or
 receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them”.
</p>
<p>The plurality and multiplicity of the Indian Culture is evident to the whole World as India has one 
of the world’s largest collections of songs, music, dance, theatre, folk traditions, performing arts,
rites and rituals, languages, dialects, paintings and writings that are known, as the ‘Intangible Cultural 
Heritage’ (ICH) of humanity. Thus, on this premise was born the philosophy and the concept of having academies 
of national importance.

The year 1950 was a milestone to an epoch-making decade in India’s history, since that was the year India 
declared itself as a sovereign republic. The Planning Commission of India was set up on 15 March 1950.
 This Commission in its very first plan envisaged that culture is integral to the Planning process as a 
 whole. That it is intrinsic to the concept of planned national development.

<p>With every subsequent Plan periods, the Government of India founded a number of institutions that determined its 
 cultural policy and also thereby determined, for several other agencies, the dominant paradigms for the ‘arts & culture’ 
 field as a whole. Among the major ones are the Indian Council of Cultural Relations (1950), the Sangeet Natak Akademi (1953), 
 the National Museum, the Sahitya Akademi, the National Gallery of Modern Art and the Lalit Kala Akademi (all set up in 1954, 
 following a Parliamentary Resolution initiated by India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru and first Education Minister,
  Maulana Azad), the Film Institute of India (1959), the National School of Drama (1959) and the National Institute of Design (1961).
