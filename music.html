        <h2>Dance</h2>
        <p>Bharatanatyam, Tamil Nadu (Southern India)
            Bharatanatyam of Tamil Nadu in southern India has grown out of the art of dancers dedicated to temples,
             and was earlier known as Sadir or Dasi Attam. It is the first of India's traditional dances to be refashioned 
             as a theatre art and to be exhibited widely both at home and abroad.
            
            Bharatanatyam rests on principles of performance and an aesthetics set down in classics such as Bharata's
             Natyashastra. It has a rich repertoire of songs in Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit. The present-day format of a 
             Bharatanatyam recital, as well as a valuable part of its musical compositions, were created by the famed
              ‘Tanjore Quartet’ of the nineteenth century: the brothers Ponniah, Chinnaiah, Sivanandam and Vadivelu. 
              Bharatanatyam has a highly evolved language of Nritta, abstract dance, and Nritya which unfolds the narrative</p>
              <p>Manipuri dance, evolved in Manipur in north-eastern India, is anchored in the Vaishnava faith of the Meiteis,
                 or people of the Manipur valley. The temples of Manipur are still among the principal staging venues of the 
                 dance. Therefore the predominant theme of Manipuri dance is devotion, and the rich lore of Radha and Krishna 
                 lends it episodic content. Over a period of centuries, the traditional art has gone through various stages
                  of development to become the sophisticated theatre art it is today.</p>
                  <p>Kathak is the principal dance of northern India, and is widely practised in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, 
                    Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, and even parts of western and eastern India today. It is believed to be connected
                     with the narrative art of Kathakaras or story-tellers who have expounded the scriptures, the epics
                      Ramayana and Mahabharata, and puranic literature to the lay masses since ancient times. Expanding 
                      and refining its movement and vocabulary of expression, this art possibly transited to a courtly 
                      milieu in medieval India, and achieved its finest flowering under Mughal rule. Later, in the nineteenth
                       century, the princely courts at Lucknow, Jaipur, Raigarh, and other places emerged as leading centres
                        of Kathak dance. During the twentieth century, as training and practice of Kathak increasingly 
                        received the support of public institutions, choreographic work involving groups of dancers has
                         claimed more space in Kathak practice. Kathak's thematic content today straddles various worlds, 
                         even though the lore of Krishna still has a special place in its repertoire. Kathak is characterized
                          stylistically by its footwork and pirouettes, and is pre-eminently a dance of rhythm-play. A recital
                          
                          opens with an amad and moves on to that, Gat Nikas, paran and tatkar, segments that offer scope for
                          
                          dance to varying rhythms and tempos, and both abstract and expressive dance. The music of traditional
                           Kathak consists of the Thumri and other lyrical song-forms, and the essential musical instruments
                            are the Tabla, Pakhawaj, and Sarangi. The sitar and other plucked strings are also associated with 
                            Kathak performed today.</p>
                            <p>Odissi dance has its origins in Orissa in eastern India, where in its rudimentary form 
                                it was performed as part of temple service by ‘maharis’ or female temple servants. 
                                The traditional dance was remoulded as a theatre art towards the middle of the twentieth
                                 century with reference not only to the existing dance art, but representation of dance in 
                                 Orissa’s medieval sculpture, painting, and literature. In its remodelled form, Odissi dance 
                                 has spread quickly across the country.</p>
