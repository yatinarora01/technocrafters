        <p>Library service comes under the aegis of State Governments and the States vary in their size, population, literacy rate, production of literature in regional languages and library infrastructure.

            THE BEGINNING
            HH Sayaji Rao Gaekwad III, Maharaja of Baroda, pioneered the development of Public Library System in India as early as 1910.The Maharaja insisted that “libraries should not limit their benefits to the few English knowing readers, but should see to it that their good work permeates through to the many”, and that “the vernacular libraries should be encouraged” so that every citizen of the State “may enrol himself as a pupil in the peoples’ university-the library. He established a Library Department with Mr. W. A.Borden as the first full time Director of State Libraries. A Central Library at Baroda with a nucleus collection of 88,764 volumes including the Maharaja’s private collection of 20,000 books was established with a full time Curator. The Maharaja also established an Oriental Institute and Library with 6,846 printed books and 1,420 manuscripts in Sanskrit, Gujarati and other languages. He was the first to initiate the publication of Gaekwad’s Oriental Series in 1915.
            
            It is mind-boggling to learn that even a century ago the Maharaja arranged to purchase a Photostat camera and a camera projector by the State. The projector was utilized to view the silent films etc. He started Library Associations from Taluk level, organized ‘Mitra Mandal’ in the town & villages and organized regular library conferences. Mobile library service was organized to cater to the book need at remote villages.
            
            THE DEVELOPMENT and PUBLIC LIBRARY LEGISLATION
            In India, there are 54,856 public libraries starting from English Colony Library at Chennai in 1661. 1972 was declared as International Book Year with the slogan BOOKS FOR ALL.Even before Independence, Kolhapur Princely State, in the Western India passed Public Libraries Act in 1945. 19 States of the Indian Union have successfully passed the library legislation. In the coming few years, there is greater possibility for a library law being enacted in the remaining States.
