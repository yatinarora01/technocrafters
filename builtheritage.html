        <p>Monuments
            The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 defines an ‘ Ancient Monument ’ as follows:-
            
            Ancient Monument means any structure, erection or monument, or any tumulus or place of interment, or any cave,
             rock-sculpture, inscription or monolith which is of historical, archaeological or artistic interest and which
              has been in existence for not less than 100 years and includes—
            </p>
        <p> 1.Remains of an ancient monument, </p>
        <p> 2.Site of an ancient monument, </p>
        <p>3.Such portion of land adjoining the site of an ancient monument as may be required for fencing or 
            covering in or otherwise preserving such monument, </p>
        <p> 4.The means of access to, and convenient inspection of, an ancient monument; </p>
         <P>The section 2(d) defines archaeological site and remains as follows:</P>
         <P>Archaeological site and remains means any area which contains or is reasonably believed to contain ruins or
             relics of historical or archaeological importance which have been in existence for not less than one hundred
              years, and includes—</P>
              <P>1. Such portion of land adjoining the area as may be required for fencing or covering in or otherwise
                 preserving it, and</P>
                <P>2.The means of access to, and convenient inspection of the area;</P>
            <P>Protection of monuments </P>
            <P>The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) under the provisions of the AMASR Act, 1958 (as amended in 2010) 
                protects monuments, sites and remains of national importance. It gives a two-months’ notice for inviting
                 objections, if any in this regard. After the specified two-month’s period, and after scrutinizing the
                  objections, if any, received in this regard, the ASI makes decision to bring a monument under its
                   protection. There are at present more than 3696 ancient monuments and archaeological sites and
                    remains of national importance. These monuments belong to different periods, ranging from the 
                    prehistoric period to the colonial period and are located in different geographical settings.
                     They include temples, mosques, tombs, churches, cemeteries, forts, palaces, stepwells, rock-cut
                      caves, and secular architecture as well as ancient mounds and sites which represent the remains
                       of ancient habitation. </P>
